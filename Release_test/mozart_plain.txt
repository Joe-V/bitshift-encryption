Vienna, Nov. 16, 1781. 

I THANK you a thousand times for your congrat- 
ulations on my name-day, and send you mine for 
Leopold-day. My dearest and kindest father, I wish 
you every imaginable good that can be devised, and 
indeed I do so for my own sake, even more than for 
yours. So I wish (/or my own sake) that you may 
continue in health, and live for countless years to 
the increase of my peace and happiness. I wish 
that all I do and undertake may be in accordance 
with your desire and pleasure, or rather that I may 
never do anything which does not ultimately cause 
you happiness. I hope it may be so, for wliatever 
contributes to your son's happiness must of course 
be welcome to you also. Herr von Aurnhammer, 
(in whose house I am now waiting,) his wife, and 
the two young ladies, also send you their best wishes. 
The Duke of Wiirtemberg is expected to-day, so 
to-morrow there is to be a masked ball, and on the 
25th a public Redoute at Schonbrunn. A consid- 
erable emharras has arisen about this, for according 
to general report the Grand-Duke is to remain here 
only ten days, whereas St. Catharine's day, (for 
which the ball has been fixed,) according to the 
Greek calendar, falls on the 6th of December. No 
one knows yet what will be done. I must tell you 
a divertino; incident. The actors were commanded 
by the Emperor each to select a part to perform 
before the Grand-Duke. Lange [Aloysia's hus- 
band] applied for that of Hamlet, but Count Ro- 
senberg, who does not like Lange, said that could 
not be, because Brockmann had always played 
the part here. When this was repeated to Brock- 
mann, he went to Rosenberg, and told him that he 
could not appear in the part, and that the play 
could not be performed at all. And why? Be- 
cause the Grand-Duke himself had all along played 
the part of Hamlet too well! The Emperor (they 
say — they say — they say) sent Brockmann fifty 
ducats on hearing it. Now I have no more news.
